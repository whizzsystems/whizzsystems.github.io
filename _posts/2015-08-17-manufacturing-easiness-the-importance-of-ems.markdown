---
The world has slowly but surely moved into a more technical age and many aspects of life and trade that were once hard to achieve or downright thought impossible have now become a part of everyday life. At the very centre of this new digital world and from which most of the technology that helps create life easy has emerged is the study of electrical energy and electronics. Looking around in today’s world, it is pretty obvious that electronic devices and machinery have been integrated and have become essential parts of everyday life. Though many consider the electronic device as the provider of ease and convenience, the true appreciation lies towards the somewhat unsung heroes that have actually created the device which are the electronics manufacturing services (ems). As the world moves forward at a speedy pace in the field of technology, the need of the hour is constantly changing. Due to the rapid evolution of electronic, electrical and mechanical technology it is essential to come up with new and better devices. These devices that are commonly used are not discovered or found; rather they are conceived by genius minds and invented by electronics manufacturing services (ems). Every device that is being used today ranging from the most basic to the extremely complex has been created by a company that provides EMS.


Ever pushing the boundaries of human imagination and creativity, today companies that provide ems EMS have come up with complex systems that work within other systems to contribute to the overall efficiency and functionality of the device such as embedded systems. An embedded system is basically software that is designed to perform a specific function with a device and these are highly useful since many devices have to perform multiple tasks. The embedded systems development process is not much different than designing a new product and involves similar steps. The first thing that must be kept into account during the embedded systems development is the detailed analysis of the customers need. Having a clear idea on what the requirement is the best way to avoid complications ahead into to the project. The overall architectural design of the system must be feasible to work with. Once the designs have all been planned and deliberated upon, the next stage of development which involves systems engineering can commence. It is true that a complex machine that has to perform complex task also take a very complicated procedure to come into existence but as mentioned, the companies that provide ems consists of some of the brightest minds humanity has to offer. Once the all the required systems development is accomplished the next phase involves one of the most crucial stages that must be done if a high quality and reliable device are desired as an end product and that stage is troubleshooting and debugging. Testing and troubleshooting usually are part of a single process, but this varies from company to company. After this complicated process, a device is finally ready for the market.
