title: Radio Frequency and Wireless Design Importance

RF stands for Radio Frequency and is a well implemented and used subset of engineering that composes of devices that are designed to operate on radio frequency (RF). This technology is implemented in any device that is capable of a sending or receiving radio waves such as mobile phones, and Wi-Fi networks. One of the aspects that is most important and adds significant success towards the popularity of the rf/wireless circuit design is its overall power consumption and compact designs. As devices especially mobile phones have gotten slimmer and smaller as technology has progressed, to prolong the time between battery recharge and the overall use, companies have started to use power conscious ICs for radio frequency, baseband and DSP.

RF and wireless features have become an important and highly sought after aspect of any device in today’s age of connectivity and with the dawn of the Internet of Things and its inevitable mass scale implementation just around the corner has made the requirement of devices being wirelessly connected all the more important. There are some aspects that must be taken into consideration however when developing rf/wireless circuits. First of all the designer should have a good understanding of the requirements and the overall design of the device in which the wireless circuit is to be implemented. Bulky and large circuits had become obsolete even before they became popular since they were never feasible in devices. For example, mobile phones in the past usually were very large and bulky with limited functions and actually had large antennas as part of their designs as opposed to today’s slimmer phones that have larger screen sizes, tons of functions, high connectivity options, and smaller sized radio circuits. A good practice to have useable and high-quality wireless circuits for a device is to have help from professionals who are experts in taking trough designs and bring them up to optimum efficiency.


Rf/wireless circuit designs are useless if they are not cost efficient. No matter how good the initial design and application of a circuit, it is just not bound for success if it is expensive to manufacture as the single circuit is composed of many smaller components. During the planning stages, a balance between the feasibility and the cost required should be worked out and as progress is made, the economic value of developing the circuit should be kept as low as possible. There are many companies in the world that specialize in radio frequency and wireless circuit design processes and are usually experts in different fields such as installations, designing, and maintenance. Technology is evolving at a rapid rate and as mentioned, the new phenomenon that is the Internet of Things will make Rf and Wireless technology essential towards not only mobile devices but towards every electronic device.
