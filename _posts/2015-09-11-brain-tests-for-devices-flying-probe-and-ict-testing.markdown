The world has become heavily dependent on machines and electronic devices. These new inventions have been created in order to make human life easy and more productive since they perform multiple tasks, have many applications are a convenient time, savers. Any electrical or electronic device or machine no matter how simple or complex is made up of different components that perform different functions within the device and are designed to be assembled in the overall design. One of the most important components of any electronics device are printed circuit boards (PCB) and printed circuit assemblies (PCA). These are usually known as the brain of the device and are tasked with the most important function within a device which is to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components within the machine. In this regard, these components are given special attention and even have their own testing methods.

Flying probe test systems are used to test the basic boards or components which are usually in the prototyping stages. A flying probe test is designed to use electro-mechanically controlled probes that are used to access components on PCBs or PCAs to determine flaws and troubleshoot problems. Flying probe testing is highly useful and is also very economically feasible since it has a much lower cost than the testing method known as Bed of nails. Flying probe testing is also more convenient since it has a fast time to first test capability.

ICT testing is used to test a completely functional PCB board that has been populated with all of the necessary components. The main function of ICT testing is determine if there are any short circuits, or if there are any open circuits and also to test the PCBâ€™s resistance and capacitance along with others aspects that can be used to determine if the assembly is reliably fabricated. Whenever working with electronic devices especially PCB boards it is always a good idea to consider these tests and to get into touch with a reliable company such as Whizz Systems which is custom electronic product design company has the complete capabilities to run these tests.
