The world is full of intelligent people working in all of the fields ranging from art and engineering, all contributing to the betterment of humanity. Though many people consider painters and entertainers as artists, they fail to appreciate that engineering is an art in itself albeit of a different kind. People who are well versed in the study of engineering technologies often end up creating valuable devices and machines that serve a testament to the ever need of humans to make their life easier. Though we have use of many machines and technologies at our disposal, it is always a humble practice to consider how these machines and devices actually come into being.

Electronics engineering is the discipline from which all of the electronic devices that have come into existence stem from. Though they are easy to use and reliable they are not from the start found in their final states, indeed in the electronics engineering field, a device that has been brainstormed goes through detailed and long process to final come into existence. a part of this process is testing. Prototyping is one of the final and most robust ways of testing out a device to work out its complexities and design flaws. Prototyping a device is highly useful albeit costly for most companies for it allows them to gain full confidence in the capabilities and uses of the device along with potential problems it may face before it can be made ready for the market.

Thermal analysis is another form of testing, but this is unique since it is usually done before the prototyping and after it. Thermal analysis is the detailed study of the changing effects heat can have on materials. Electronic devices run on electricity, the passing current causes the components of a device to heat up and may result in damages. To avoid such hazards, this is one of the most useful tests that can be done to produce a nearly flawless and robust device.
