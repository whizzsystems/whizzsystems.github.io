title: The Brain of a Device â€“ Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)
layout: post
---
Since the dawn of the 20th century, the world as consciously ushered into a new age that is very much digital and technical in nature and has led to the discovery and the invention of numerous new technologies. At the heart of this new technical age is the study and application of electrical and electronic devices. Any device no matter how complex functions due to numerous mechanical and electronic components that are dependent on electricity. However for a device to have basic functionality a middle circuit is required whose job is to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic component. The part that performs this important task is called a PCB which stands for printed circuit boards. PCBs are produced by an electronic manufacturing company and are used in the most basic and simplest electronics.

PCBs are an essential part of an electronic device and the functionality, efficiency and quality of a device almost always depend on the quality and design of a PCB. This is the reason that most printed circuit board manufacturers relate to PCBs as the brain of a device. In this regard, the proper and high-quality manufacturing of the PCB must be given importance. When a device concept is conceived the design of the PCB is taken into account. A good electronic manufacturing company usually has specialists tasked with coming up with the concept along with the required capabilities that the PCB will have including its shape. Once the basic conception is done, the layout and the final design of the printed circuit board is brought into existence by a team of professionals. The best way to ensure the PCB is worthwhile is to put it through thorough testing even moving into the prototype stage. Once the printed circuit board is found optimal it is then put up for manufacturing.
There are a number of types of PCBs that are manufactured for various devices. For most of the basic electronic devices single layered PCBs are used, however for complex hardware such as high-end computers and machinery, PCBs can have up to 12 layers and are usually green.
