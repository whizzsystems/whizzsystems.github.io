Telecommunication can be described as the exchange of information between two or more than two entities through technological means. Telecommunication uses channels to send out information as electrical signals either over physical or digital mediums. Physical mediums can be signal cables and digital medium can be electromagnetic waves. Telecom devices usually have a transmitter and a receiver and the most common example of modern telecom devices are the mobile phones that are connected to a vast net of telecommunications network that is used to share information between people and device.A network is usually a telecommunications network which allows computers and other devices that are connected to it share data between them and those on other networks through data connections.

Telecom and networking product design and development is a service that is offered by many companies that provide engineering services and it is one of the most sought after and important services required to an organization or individuals. There are many challenges associated with telecom products developments and some of the most important things that need to be kept in perspective during development are functional performance, availability and reliability of the telecom product. These products include the likes of Broadband Infrastructure Products, IP Networks, Cable Modems and Set-Top Boxes, DSL Modems and Routers, FO Switches, GSM, GPRS and 3G/4G Wireless Protocols, WLAN and Bluetooth. As technology is movie forward a new type of communications network is slowly but surely taking hold in the world of electronic devices. This new technology is Internet of Things which will allows billions of devices to be always connected. This has given arise to the need for developing devices that have some form of telecommunications and networking infrastructure present within them which will allows them to be connected consistently to a network and work more efficiently. 

Telecom and networking product design and development have similar procedures to other electronic devices. When designing a telecom product it is best to capture the core requirements of what the device has to accomplish when put to work in a telecommunications network. A product that is required to perform telecommunications services while being connected to a network like a router must be capable and reliable and be free of needless complexities that may hinder it to reach its full potential and become a problem for the user. To avoid such problems, proper planning and in-depth refining of the requirements to be fulfilled by the product should be done before the idea has been finalized. The hardware and software used should be as per the requirements. Networking devices require thorough testing for they are needed to establish and maintain constant and clean connections between two devices through a network.
