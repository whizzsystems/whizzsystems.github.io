The world is full of intelligent people that come up with great ideas for new devices and inventions that can have great uses and wide-spread applications in multiple fields. As it is known that at the base of any new technology is electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering. As conception for a new device is conceived, it is simply not feasible or smart to right out the door starts building the device on just basic planning and hunches. Whenever a new technology is started on the path to becoming a physical product, it goes through some fleshed out process that include designs and manufacturing. When working on new devices a common practice known as electronic design process come into effect where the conception, design and brief analysis of the applications of the device are decided. The design process includes drawings and in-depth analysis of the feasibility and workability of the project at hand. There are a number of firms in the world that provides this specific service regarding different fields meaning a firm providing electronic services will be called an electronic design company.

One of the core aspects of any electronic device are the PCBs and it is highly wise to acquire the services of an electronic design company that also are familiar with the process and acts as printed circuit board manufacturers. Printed circuit board PCB design, Manufacturing, and Assembly is one of the essential parts of any electronic design process and are the ones responsible for providing complex embedded hardware designs for the optimal performance of any device. An embedded software and firmware Design and development is a usually a complete computer system that has the sole purpose of performing a single task is the overall device and the embedded system design must be done professionally and is very important since it has to be fixated with other electrical and mechanical part of a device in order for it to work correctly.
